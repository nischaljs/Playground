## ⚠️ WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL CODE AHEAD ⚠️

Nothing in this repository is intended for production use. It is my personal space for:

1.  Learning New Tech (e.g., SvelteKit, Rust, Kubernetes)
2.  Prototyping Ideas
3.  Making Glorious Mistakes

If you see a broken test, please know I saw it first and *chose* to leave it as a monument to my struggle.
